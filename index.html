          <p><b>1999 - 2000</b>War, and was wounded in 1917 and again mentioned in dispatches.[3] He remained hospitalised for his wounds until 1921.[3] In 1923, he married Isabel Higgon, née Denroche-Smith, a widow of Archie Higgon, who had been killed in action in 1915.[3] Isobel's family home was near Alyth, North Perthshire, and her father had
               been a civil servant in Bengal</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2000 - 2002</b>Robert Goff was born in Perthshire, Scotland, on 12 November 1926, as the second child and only son of Lionel Trevor Goff (1877–1953) and Isobel Jane Higgon (née Denroche-Smith).[3] Lionel studied at Eton College and the
             Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1897.[3] As a young officer, Lionel fought in the Second Boer War, was wounded in the Siege of Ladysmith and was mentioned in dispatches.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2003 - 2004</b>War, and was wounded in 1917 and again mentioned in dispatches.[3] He remained hospitalised for his wounds until 1921.[3] In 1923, he married Isabel Higgon, née Denroche-Smith, a widow of Archie Higgon, who had been killed in action in 1915.[3] Isobel's family home was near Alyth, North Perthshire, and her father had
             been a civil servant in Bengal.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>1990 - 1992</b>Robert was brought up at the Goff home in Monk Sherborne, Hampshire.[3] He had a closer relationship with his mother than his father. Lionel's principal interests were in fishing, hunting, shooting and riding, and he did not share his son's passion for music.[3] Likewise, Robert did not share his father's interests, and
             gave up shooting after he turned eighteen.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2000 - 2010</b>In 1948, Goff took up his place at Oxford for a two-year "shortened" Final Honour Schools course for ex-servicemen.[3] Having been given a choice between reading Jurisprudence, Greats or History,
             he chose Jurisprudence, with the aim of practicing as a barrister after graduating.[3] At New College, his tutors included Jack Butterworth and Wilfrid Bourne.[3] He graduated with a First Class Degree in 1950, having served as Steward of the Junior Common Room.[3]</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2002 - 2003</b>In 1952, Goff was appointed to a Common University Fund lectureship in law, to take effect in 1953.[3] In this capacity, he was required to give a series of lectures on any area of interest to him.[2] When exploring
             texts for inspiration, he chanced upon "quasi-contracts", a concept traceable to Roman law, but which was at that point unrecognised in English law.[2] Together with Ronald Maudsley, then the law tutor at Brasenose College, he set up a series of seminars[2] in
              Restitution, also described as "Unjustifiable Enrichment" and "Quasi Contract".[3] The lectures were not on the syllabus and not many students attended.[3] They did attract academic attendees,</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2008 - 2007</b>across an article written by Maudsley, which he believed to be based heavily
             on the material they had prepared in their joint lectures.[4][6] Goff wrote to Maudsley once again, but upon not receiving a reply, concluded that Maudsley "was signing off and didn't feel able to tell me".[4] As a junior barrister with a growing practice, Goff realised that if his book was to be completed, he would need a collaborator.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2005 - 2004</b>Upon its release, the book was quickly recognised as a significant work, and was largely favourably reviewed. Lord Denning reflected positively on it, calling it "a creative work" and comparing
             it to Sir Frederick Pollock's treatise on torts and the seminal textbook Anson's Law of Contract.[9] Edmund Davies, then a judge of the High Court of Justice, described it as "admirable".</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2007 - 2008</b>Goff believed the publication of Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution in 1966 to be one of the reasons he was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) the following year.[3][4] After this, his practice grew significantly.[3] He appeared in significant and technically difficult commercial
             cases such as The Mihalis Angelos,[12] and The Brimnes.[13] His choice of junior was Brian Davenport, a close friend whom he described as "exceptionally gifted", but who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early thirties.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>1950 - 1970</b>In 1974, Goff was appointed Recorder of the Crown Court.[3] In October 1975, after eight years as a QC, Goff was appointed to the High Court, and received the customary knighthood.[3] He spent seven years at the High Court, two of which he spent as the Judge-in-Charge of the Commercial Court.[3] In 1982, he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal and sworn
             in as a Privy Councillor.[3] On 6 February 1986, Goff was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and a life peer as Baron Goff of Chieveley,</p>
